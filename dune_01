where blockchain = 'ethereum'
    and symbol like 'E%'  -- 代币符号以字母E开头
order by decimals desc,symbol asc -- 先按代币支持的小数位数降序排列，再按代币符号升序排列


As定义别名. as 可以省略
select t.contract_address  "代币合约地址",
    t.decimals  "代币小数",
    t.symbol  "代币符号"
from tokens.erc20  t
limit 10

使用distinct可以筛选出字段的唯一值
select distinct blockchain
from tokens.erc20
now()可以获得当前系统的日期时间值。我们还可以使用current_date来得到当前系统日期
select now()  ,current_date

date_trunc('day', block_time)将block_time的值转换为以“天”表示的日期值

select 
 date_trunc('day',now())as today
 ,date_trunc('month',now()) as current_month
 ,date_trunc('year',now()) as current_year

nterval获取时间间隔

select now() as right_now,
    (now() - interval '2' hour) as two_hours_ago,
    (now() - interval '2' day) as two_days_ago,
    (current_date - interval '1' year) as one_year_ago

Concat 连接字符串
select concat('Hello','world!') as hello_world,
    'Hello' || ' ' || 'world'|| '!' as hello_world_again

Cast转换字段数据类型，data_type 'value string'操作符方式完成类型转换
select (cast(21 as varchar) || 'users') as User_count
    ,integer '123' as intval,
    timestamp '2023-08-31 16:00' as dt_time

Power求幂
select 1.23 * power(10,18) as raw_aomunt,
     1230000000000000000 / pow(10, 18) as original_amount,
     7890000 / 1e6 as usd_amount
